<h2>How to easily make a bacon sandwich!</h2>
        <p>This recipe will show you how to easily make a bacon sandwich with just a few basic ingredients. This recipe is delicious and low cost, and is so simple that you can even get the kids to help!</p>

        <h3>What ingredients you will need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bacon</strong>Use thick-cut bacon for the best sandwich.</li>
            <li><strong>Chipotle mayonnaise</strong>We mix some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to make this. You can also look for some store-bought chipotle mayo.</li>
            <li><strong>Caramelized onions</strong>These are best sauteed in some of the leftover bacon oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Bread</strong>We like soft sandwich bread the best for this recipe. Sourdough is great, too.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong>If tomatoes aren't in season either omit them or use cherry tomatoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Arugula</strong>The slightly spicy bite works well in the recipe. You can also substitute another type of lettuce.</li>
          
        </ul>

        <h3>Here are the steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by frying some thick slices of bacon in a pan until nice and crispy.</li>

            <li>Drain most of the bacon oil out of the pan (save it to use in another recipe!) then saute the onions in the bit of oil that is left.</li>

            <li>Mix some mayonnaise with chipotle peppers to make a smoky mayo.</li>

            <li>Lightly toast the bread; either in a toaster or (even better) in the pan you used to cook the bacon and onions.</li>

            <li>Now it's time to make the sandwich! Spread the chipotle mayo on the toast then top with crispy bacon, caramelized onions, slices of tomato, and a small handful of arugula.</li>         
        </ol>
